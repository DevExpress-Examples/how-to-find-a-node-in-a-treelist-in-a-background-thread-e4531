# How to find a node in a TreeList in a background thread


<p>This example demonstrates how to find a specific node in TreeList in a separate thread.</p><p>Please note that the approach shown in the project is very specific.</p><p>Searching for nodes in a separate thread works correctly only when TreeList is disabled. We do not recommend you enable TreeList during searching because any user activity with TreeList can cause unexpected effects.</p>
